I am an environmental scientist specialising in remote sensing data
analysis, in particular the analysis of time series of coarse resolution satellite
images for vegetation monitoring. My main research interests concern the __use of
remotely sensed images for the analysis of vegetation characteristics at different
spatial scales__.

I graduated Environmental Sciences at the University of Milano-Bicocca in 2001.
My graduation thesis work focused on the __classification of aerial hyperspectral data__
for the identification of asbestos-concrete roofs. 

After graduation, my work focused on developing techniques for __estimation 
of vegetation biochemical and structural parameters__ useful for carbon balance modeling,
and analysis of MODIS time series for forest monitoring. I worked on the estimation 
of Primary Production of forest ecosystems in Lombardia using a light use efficiency
model driven by MODIS-derived fAPAR maps and meteorological data. This was also the topic 
of my PhD at the University of Milano-Bicocca (graduated 2007).

My main post-doctoral research activity concerned the __use of MODIS data for phenological
monitoring and the analysis of relationships between phenological and climatic 
interannual variability__ in Alpine areas, as well as for the analysis of post-fire
vegetation regeneration from MODIS satellite data, and the estimation of Above Ground
Biomass increment from Remote Sensing and Forest Inventory data.

I am currently employed at the [Institute for Remote Sensing of Environment](www.irea.cnr.it/en/) of the
Italian National Research Council (CNR-IREA), were I mainly work on __analysing
remote sensing data at various spatial and temporal resolutions for agriculture
applications__.
