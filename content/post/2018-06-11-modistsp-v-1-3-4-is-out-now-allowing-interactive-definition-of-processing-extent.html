<p>We are happy to report that a new version of <a href="http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/">MODIStsp</a> (1.3.4) is on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MODIStsp/index.html">CRAN</a> as of today !</p>
<p>The new version introduces a <strong>strongly improved GUI</strong> (thanks mainly to <span class="citation">@lwasser</span>
comments in her <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/184">review for MODIStsp onboarding on ropensci</a>). The new GUI facilitates
the selection of layers to be processed, and allows interactive selection of
the processing spatial extent over a map (thanks to <span class="citation">@timsalabim</span> and <span class="citation">@timelyportfolio</span>
for implementing some changes on mapview to allow this!). The main changes introduced in the GUI are
<strong>highlighted in the image and animation below</strong>:</p>

<p>Besides this, the <strong>main changes with respect to version 1.3.3</strong> are related to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Inclusion of some <strong>new MODIS products</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Removal of almost all v005 products</strong>, which were recently deprecated by NASA;</li>
<li><strong>Removal of FTP download</strong> functionality again due to deprecation from NASA;</li>
<li><strong>Improvement in functionality for dealing with NoData</strong> for products with multiple
fill-values. If “Change NoData” is set to “Yes”, then in case a layer
has multiple Nodata values all those values are set to NA in the output;</li>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous bug fixing</strong> and code refactoring.</li>
</ol>
<p>The full changelog for v1.3.4 can be found <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp/releases/tag/v1.3.4">HERE</a></p>
<p>We hope you will find the new version useful and that we didn’t introduce too
many bugs ! <strong>Please report any problems in our
<a href="https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp/issues">issues</a> GitHub page.</strong></p>
