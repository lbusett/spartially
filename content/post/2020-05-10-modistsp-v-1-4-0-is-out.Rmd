A new version of [MODIStsp](http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/) (1.4.0) is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MODIStsp/index.html) as of today ! 

This version: 

- Switches to use of GDAL3/PROJ6 WKTs for projection representation, using sf::gdal_utils to perform gdalwarp/gdaltranslate instead of gdalUtils on external GDAL;

- Switches to use of `sf` for all internal work on vector data;

- Removes sp, rgdal, rgeos, pacman, gdalUtils dependencies;

- Adds support for products MCD19A1 and MCD19A2 products.
