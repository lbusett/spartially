A new version of [MODIStsp](http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/) (1.3.8) is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MODIStsp/index.html) as of today ! 

The new version fixes a nasty issue introduced by changes in `gdal_buildvrt` behaviour in GDAL > 2.3, 
(https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3221#comment:5) which caused problems in proper application of scales and offset on MODIS layers - see https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp/issues/163

If you are experiencing problems with `MODIStsp` and you have GDAL > 2.3 on your system, you 
are strongly encouraged to update the package!

Besides this, `MODIStsp 1.3.8` introduces some minor bug fixes, and **adds support for 
products MOD21A1D.006, MOD21A1N.006 and MOD21A2.006**

The full changelog for v1.3.8 can be found [HERE](https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp/releases/tag/v1.3.8)

We hope you will find the new version useful and that we didn't introduce too
many bugs ! 

**As usual, please report any problems in our [issues](https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp/issues) GitHub page.**
