<p>A new version of <a href="http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/">MODIStsp</a> (1.3.8) is on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MODIStsp/index.html">CRAN</a> as of today !</p>
<p>The new version fixes a nasty issue introduced by changes in <code>gdal_buildvrt</code> behaviour in GDAL &gt; 2.3,
(<a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3221#comment:5" class="uri">https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3221#comment:5</a>) which caused problems in proper application of scales and offset on MODIS layers - see <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp/issues/163" class="uri">https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp/issues/163</a></p>
<p>If you are experiencing problems with <code>MODIStsp</code> and you have GDAL &gt; 2.3 on your system, you
are strongly encouraged to update the package!</p>
<p>Besides this, <code>MODIStsp 1.3.8</code> introduces some minor bug fixes, and <strong>adds support for
products MOD21A1D.006, MOD21A1N.006 and MOD21A2.006</strong></p>
<p>The full changelog for v1.3.8 can be found <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp/releases/tag/v1.3.8">HERE</a></p>
<p>We hope you will find the new version useful and that we didnâ€™t introduce too
many bugs !</p>
