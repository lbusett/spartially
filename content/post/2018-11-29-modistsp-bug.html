<p>We are sorry to report that we recently discovered a nasty bug (or rather, a stupid mistake…) in the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp">MODIStsp</a> package.</p>
<p>The bug led to improper computation of custom spectral indices in the case that their formula included addition or subtraction operations on reflectance values (e.g., something like <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(\rho_{NIR}+0.1)}{\rho_{Red}}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> indicating a reflectance).</p>
<div id="what-is-affected" class="section level2">
<h2>What is affected</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Values of the following <em>Additional Spectral Indices</em> selectable using the MODIStsp GUI:</p>
<ul>
<li>EVI</li>
<li>SAVI</li>
</ul>
<p>, <em>in the case that the <strong>Apply Scale/Offset</strong> option was set to “No”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Values of any <em>custom spectral indexes</em> added by the user, in case they included additive or subtractive coefficients.</p>
<p>, <em>in the case that the <strong>Apply Scale/Offset</strong> option was set to “No”</em></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-is-not-affected" class="section level2">
<h2>What is NOT affected</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Values of spectral indexes available in MODIS HDF images as original sds layers (e.g., EVI in MOD13Q1)</p></li>
<li><p>Values of any additional / custom spectral indexes in case they did not include additive or
subtractive coefficients, or the <strong>Apply Scale/Offset</strong> option was set to “Yes”</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-to-do-if-you-are-affected" class="section level2">
<h2>What to do if you are affected</h2>
<p>The bug is now fixed on the GitHub version. A patched release will be made available on CRAN as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you have
time series processed with the old version falling in the “What is affected” category, there’s nothing you can do, save for reprocessing them.</p>
<p><strong>We are truly sorry for the problem</strong>, which somehow managed to slip under the radar until now.
We hope it will not bring you too much trouble!</p>

<div id="what-exactly-was-the-problem" class="section level2">
<h2>What exactly was the problem?</h2>
<p>This is <strong>so basic that can easily go unnoticed.</strong> So it’s better to document it…</p>
<p>MODIS reflectances are stored in HDF layers as integers with a 10000 scale factor (e.g., a 0.1 reflectance is stored as 1000). If you need to “manually” compute an index such as SAVI:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(SAVI = \frac{(\rho_{NIR} - \rho_{Red})}{(\rho_{NIR} + \rho_{Red} + 0.5)} * (1 + 0.5)\)</span>).</p>
<p>starting from MODIS reflectances, you must take care of multiplying the MODIS data by 10E-4 beforehand. Your formula then becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(SAVI = \frac{(0.0001 * b2_{NIR} - 0.0001 * b1_{Red})}{0.0001 * b2_{NIR} + 0.0001 * b1_{Red} + 0.5} * (1 + 0.5)\)</span>).</p>
<p>, otherwise the additive constants (in this case, the <span class="math inline">\(+ 0.5\)</span> in the denominator) would be made practically irrelevant.</p>
