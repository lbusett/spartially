**MODIStsp v1.3.0 has been finally released !**

It adds the much-needed functionality for downloading and preprocessing **MODIS
Collection 006 datasets**. Off-line preprocessing of already downloaded hdf images
was also improved, and the GUI was a bit revamped to improve user-friendliness 
(A detailed changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/lbusett/MODIStsp/releases/tag/v1.3.0)).

More detailed usage instructions were also added to the 
[main github page](https://github.com/lbusett/MODIStsp), and a
[FAQ section](https://github.com/lbusett/MODIStsp/wiki) addressing common issues
with the package (e.g., installation problems, etc) was added.

We hope you will find the new version useful and that we didn't introduce too 
many bugs ! **Please report any problems in our [issues](https://github.com/lbusett/MODIStsp/issues)
GitHub page.**
