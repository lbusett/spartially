The **MODIStsp** website, which lay abandoned since several months on github 
pages, recently underwent a major overhaul thanks to **[pkgdown](http://hadley.github.io/pkgdown)**.
The new site is now available at <http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/>

We hope that the revised website will allow to navigate MODIStsp-related material
much more easily than either github or the standard CRAN documentation, and will
therefore help users in better and more easily exploiting MODIStsp functionality.

The restyling was possible thanks to the very nice "**pkgdown**" R package 
(<http://hadley.github.io/pkgdown>), which allows to easily create a static documentation website.

Though pkgdown does already quite a good job in creating a bare-bones website
exploiting **just the material available in a standard devtools-based R package file 
structure**, I was surprised at **how simply the standard website could be tweaked** 
to obtain a very nice (IMO) final result without needing any particular background 
on html, css, etc. !

(On that, I plan to soon post a short guide containing a few **tips and tricks** 
I learnt in the last days for setting up and configuring a pkgdown website, so stay 
tuned !)
