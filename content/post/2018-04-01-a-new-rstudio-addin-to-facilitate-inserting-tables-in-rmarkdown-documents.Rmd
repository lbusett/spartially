In the last months, I started increasingly using `Rmd` documents for preparing scientific reports, blog posts, etcetera. While I really like the flexibility offered by the system, one thing that I thought could be improved is the support for easily inserting table. So, also "inspired" by the recent addition of the excellent [__`insert image` addin__](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/03/07/blogdown-insert-image-addin/#.WsEt2YhuaHs) in `blogdown`, I decided to give it a go and try to implement some kind of addin to ease table insertion in `Rmd` documentents. 



After struggling a bit due to my rather inexistent shiny skills, in the end I manage to obtain a "basic but useful" addin. Let's see how it works"

## Usage

You can install the addin from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lbusett/insert_table")
```

## Usage

Upon installing, `inserttable` registers a new RStudio Addin (__Insert Table__)
that can be used to easily insert a table in a `Rmd` document. To use it, open a `Rmd` document and, with the cursor within a `r` chunk and select  "Addins --> Insert Table". 

These are the two main __use modes__:

### Launch the addin while the cursor is on a empty line

In this case, a GUI will open allowing you to __select the desired output format__ (
`kable`, `DT` and `rhandsontable` are currently implemented), and to __edit the content of the table__. After clicking __Done__ the Addin will add in the `Rmd`
document the code needed to generate the table in a nice `tribble` format (thanks to Miles McBain's [`datapasta`](https://github.com/milesmcbain/datapasta) package!) to allow easier editing, and also the code needed to render it with the selected output format using some 
default options, as can be seen below:

A useful feature is that, for larger tables, you can also __cut and paste content from a spreadsheet__ :

Obviously, rendering of the table can be tweaked further by changing/adding arguments of the rendering functions in the automatically generated code.


### Launch the addin while selecting the name of a variable

In this case, the GUI allows you to select __only the desired output format__ (
it is assumed that the variable you select corresponds to a `data frame` or similar
object containing the data you wish to show as table). After clicking __Done__
the Addin will add in the `Rmd` document the code needed to render the selected variable as a table with the selected output format. The code will be added at the first empty line below that containing the name of the selected variable.

__IMPORTANT NOTE__: `inserttable` will make no effort to guarantee that the 
variable you select is a `data.frame`. It is up to you to select a meaningful
variable!

## Usage from the console

You can also use (part of) `inserttable` functionality from the console by calling
function `insert_table()`. 

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

> insert_table(tbl_name = "table_1", nrows = 4, ncols = 4, tbl_format = "DT")

```

The function will return __to the console__ the code needed to create a empty 
table of the specified dimensions and render it with the selected format:

####__That's all__!. 

I hope someone else will find this useful!
