##The problem 

I am in the process of migrating my (rather ugly) [small blog](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=4683863749820351779#allposts) from 
"Bloggers" to blogdown and, as several others, I choose to use the [hugo-academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) due to its good looks, 
simplicity, and "focus" towards researchers. 

One nice feature of `hugo-academic` is that it includes out-of-the-box a "Publications"
section, allowing researchers to easily create a list of their publication as a 
section of the website.

**Unfortunately**, in order to populate that list, users have to manually create one 
different `.md` file for each publication, by cutting and pasting several different 
info (e.g., title, authors, etc.) in a "simple"" template like [this one](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/archetypes/publication.md). 

**THIS IS BORING!** 

Since I was not in the mood of doing that, and no automatic solutions could be 
found (well, there appears to be a `python` one, but we are speaking `R`, here...), I
decided to try and develop some script to automatically create the required `md`
files starting from a `BibTex` list of my publications. Here are the results of 
that effort. 

##A possible sdolution

###Preparing the `BibTex` file 

To automatically create the publications `md` files, all you need is a (properly formatted)
`BibTex` file. Since I did not have one ready, I created mine by exporting my
publications list from [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=23003461400), but you 
could use any valid BibTeX file.

**One important thing, though, is that you have to be sure that the file is saved 
with UTF-8 encoding**. If you are not sure, you can open it in RStudio (or any decent
text editor), and then re-save it with a forced encoding (in RStudio, you can use 
`File-->Save with Encoding`)

###Creating an import script

Now, you need a script that reads the `BibTex` entries and use the data to populate
one different `md` file for each publication. Below you can find my attempt at this. 


```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bibtex_2academic <- function(bibfile,
                             outfold,
                             abstract = FALSE, 
                             overwrite = FALSE) {
  
  require(RefManageR)
  require(dplyr)
  require(stringr)
  require(anytime)
  
  # Import the bibtex file and convert to data.frame
  mypubs   <- ReadBib(bibfile, check = "warn", .Encoding = "UTF-8") %>%
    as.data.frame()
  
  # assign "categories" to the different types of publications
  mypubs   <- mypubs %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
      pubtype = dplyr::case_when(document_type == "Article" ~ "2",
                                 document_type == "Article in Press" ~ "2",
                                 document_type == "InProceedings" ~ "1",
                                 document_type == "Proceedings" ~ "1",
                                 document_type == "Conference" ~ "1",
                                 document_type == "Conference Paper" ~ "1",
                                 document_type == "MastersThesis" ~ "3",
                                 document_type == "PhdThesis" ~ "3",
                                 document_type == "Manual" ~ "4",
                                 document_type == "TechReport" ~ "4",
                                 document_type == "Book" ~ "5",
                                 document_type == "InCollection" ~ "6",
                                 document_type == "InBook" ~ "6",
                                 document_type == "Misc" ~ "0",
                                 TRUE ~ "0"))
  
  # create a function which populates the md template based on the info
  # about a publication
  create_md <- function(x) {
    
    # define a date and create filename by appending date and start of title
    if (!is.na(x[["year"]])) {
      x[["date"]] <- paste0(x[["year"]], "-01-01")

      x[["date"]] <- "2999-01-01"
    }
    
    filename <- paste(x[["date"]], x[["title"]] %>%

                        str_sub(1, 20) %>%
                        paste0(".md"), sep = "_")
    # start writing
    if (!file.exists(file.path(outfold, filename)) | overwrite) {
      fileConn <- file.path(outfold, filename)
      write("+++", fileConn)
      
      # Title and date

      write(paste0("authors = [\"", auth_hugo,"\"]"), fileConn, append = T)
      
      # Publication type. Legend:

      write(paste0("publication_types = [\"", x[["pubtype"]],"\"]"), 
            fileConn, append = T)
      
      # Publication details: journal, volume, issue, page numbers and doi link
      publication <- x[["journal"]]
      if (!is.na(x[["volume"]])) publication <- paste0(publication, 
                                                       ", (", x[["volume"]], ")")
      if (!is.na(x[["number"]])) publication <- paste0(publication,

      if (!is.na(x[["pages"]])) publication <- paste0(publication,
                                                      ", _pp. ", x[["pages"]], "_")
      if (!is.na(x[["doi"]])) publication <- paste0(publication,
                                                    ", ", paste0("https://doi.org/", 
                                                                 x[["doi"]]))
      
      write(paste0("publication = \"", publication,"\""), fileConn, append = T)
      write(paste0("publication_short = \"", publication,"\""),fileConn, append = T)
      
      # Abstract and optional shortened version.
      if (abstract) {
        write(paste0("abstract = \"", x[["abstract"]],"\""), fileConn, append = T)
      } else {
        write("abstract = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      }
      write(paste0("abstract_short = \"","\""), fileConn, append = T)

      write("url_dataset = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      write("url_project = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)

      write("url_poster = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)

      write("+++", fileConn, append = T)
    }
  }
  # apply the "create_md" function over the publications list to generate
  # the different "md" files.
  
  apply(mypubs, FUN = function(x) create_md(x), MARGIN = 1)
}
```

Nothing fancy, here: I just use the [`RefManageR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RefManageR/index.html) 
package to read the BibTeX file, and then cycles over publications to create 
files properly formatted for `hugo-academic` use. 

###Running the script

All is left is to run the script:

```{r eval=FALSE}

my_bibfile <- "/path/to/mybibtex.bib"
out_fold   <- "/path/to/myoutfolder"

bibtex_2academic(bibffile  = my_bibfile, 
                 outfold   = out_fold, 
                 abstract  = FALSE)

```

* The `outfold` argument allows specifying where the generated `md` files will be
saved. Though in the end they will have to be moved to folder `content/publication` you 
may want to save them at first in a different folder to be able to check them 
before trying to deploy.

* The `abstract` argument specifies whether to include the abstract in the `md` or 
not. 

Running the script will give you files like this one: 

```yml
+++
title = "Estimating canopy water content of poplar plantation from MIVIS data"
date = "2006-01-01"
authors = ["R. Colombo", "L. Busetto", "A. Marchesi", "M. Meroni", "C. Giardino"]
publication_types = ["1"]
publication = "AIP Conference Proceedings, (852), _pp. 242-249_, https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2349350"
publication_short = ""
abstract_short = ""
image_preview = ""
selected = false
projects = []
tags = []
url_pdf = ""
url_preprint = ""
url_code = ""
url_dataset = ""
url_project = ""
url_slides = ""
url_video = ""
url_poster = ""
url_source = ""
math = false
highlight = true
[header]
image = ""
caption = ""
+++
```

, where I tweaked a bit the hugo-academic format to include bibliographic 
info such as volume, number, pages and doi link. The files can then be further customized
to include, for example, links to pdfs, images, etcetera. 

After moving all the `md` files to `content/publication`, the publications section 
of your `hugo-academic` site will be auto-populated, and should look more or less
like this: 

![](/img/publications/publications.png)

You can have a look at the final results on my (under construction) website [here](https://lbusett.netlify.com/publication/). I think it's quite nice!

##Final Notes

* My importing script is quite "quick and dirty". It __does not attempt to deal 
with special characters, and even substitutes accented letters with "bare"
letters to avoid rendering problems__. If someone more knowledgeable about encoding
issues wants to try and improve it, I put it in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/lbusett/da7b1fba4345e03192a450226a17636e)

* It may happen that your site will stop rendering when you put the new `md` files
in `content/publication`. If so, the reason is probably that you have some "strange"
formatting in some of the files. Usual suspects would be unproperly recognized **accents**, 
**math formulas** or other special characters in the **authors** and **abstract**
fields. You will have to look into each file and remove any offending areas. 
(It happened to me a lot before properly saving to UTF-8)
