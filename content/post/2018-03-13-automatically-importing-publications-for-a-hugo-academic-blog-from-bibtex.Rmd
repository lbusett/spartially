##The problem 

Last week, I started migrating my (rather ugly) [blog](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=4683863749820351779#allposts) from 
"Bloggers" to blogdown. As several others, I choose to use the [hugo-academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic), due to its good look, 
simplicity, and "focus" towards researchers. 

One nice feature of "hugo-academic" is that it includes out-of-the-box a "Publications"
section, allowing researchers to easily create a list of their publication as a 
section of the website. **Unfortunately**, in order to populate that list, users 
have to manually create one different `.md` file for each publication, by cutting
and pasting several different info (e.g., title, authors, etc.) in a "simple"" yaml
template like [this one](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/archetypes/publication.md). 

**This is boring!** Since I was not in the mood of doing that, and no automatic
solutions could be found (well, there appears to be a `python` one, but here we are 
speaking `R`), I decided to try and develop some script to automatically create
the required `md`s starting from a `bibtex` list of my publications. Here are the
results of that effort. 

##The solution

###Creating the bibtex file 

To automatically create the publications `md`s, all you need is a (properly formatted)
`bibtex` file. Since I did not have one ready, I created mine by exporting from 
[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=23003461400), but you 
could use any valid bibtex file.
**One important thing is that you have to be sure that the file is saved with UTF-8 encoding**. 
If you are not sure, you can open it in RStudio (or any decent text editor), 
and then re-save it with a forced encoding (in RStudio, you can use `File-->Save with Encoding)

###Creating an import script

Now, you need a script that reads the `bibtex` entries and use the data to populate
one different `md` file for each publication. Below you can find my attempt at this. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
bibtex_2academic <- function(bibfile,
                             outfold,
                             abstract = FALSE,
                             overwrite = FALSE) {

  require(RefManageR)
  require(dplyr)
  require(stringr)
  require(anytime)

  # Import the bibtex file and convert to data.frame
  mypubs   <- ReadBib(bibfile, check = "warn", .Encoding = "UTF-8") %>%
    as.data.frame()

  # assign "categories" to the different types of publications
  mypubs   <- mypubs %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
      pubtype = dplyr::case_when(document_type == "Article" ~ "2",
                                 document_type == "Article in Press" ~ "2",
                                 document_type == "InProceedings" ~ "1",
                                 document_type == "Proceedings" ~ "1",
                                 document_type == "Conference" ~ "1",
                                 document_type == "Conference Paper" ~ "1",
                                 document_type == "MastersThesis" ~ "3",
                                 document_type == "PhdThesis" ~ "3",
                                 document_type == "Manual" ~ "4",
                                 document_type == "TechReport" ~ "4",
                                 document_type == "Book" ~ "5",
                                 document_type == "InCollection" ~ "6",
                                 document_type == "InBook" ~ "6",
                                 document_type == "Misc" ~ "0",
                                 TRUE ~ "0"))

  # create a function which populates the md template based on the info
  # about a publication
  create_md <- function(x) {

    # define a date and create filename
    if (!is.na(x[["year"]])) {
        x[["date"]] <- paste0(x[["year"]], "-01-01")
    } else {
      x[["date"]] <- "2999-01-01"
    }
    filename <- paste(x[["date"]], x[["title"]] %>%
                        str_replace_all(fixed(" "), "_") %>%
                        str_remove_all(fixed(":")) %>%
                        str_sub(1, 20) %>%
                        paste0(".md"), sep = "_")
    # start writing
    if (!file.exists(filename) | overwrite) {
      fileConn <- file.path(outfold, filename)
      write("+++", fileConn)

      # Title and date
      write(paste0("title = \"", x[["title"]], "\""), fileConn, append = T)
      write(paste0("date = \"", anydate(x[["date"]]), "\""), fileConn, append = T)

      # Authors. Comma separated list, e.g. `["Bob Smith", "David Jones"]`.
      auth_hugo <- str_replace_all(x["author"], " and ", "\", \"")
      auth_hugo <- stringi::stri_trans_general(auth_hugo, "latin-ascii")
      write(paste0("authors = [\"", auth_hugo,"\"]"), fileConn, append = T)

      # Publication type.
      # Legend:
      # 0 = Uncategorized
      # 1 = Conference paper
      # 2 = Journal article
      # 3 = Manuscript
      # 4 = Report
      # 5 = Book
      # 6 = Book section
      write(paste0("publication_types = [\"", x[["pubtype"]],"\"]"), fileConn, append = T)

      # Publication details: journal, volume, issue, page numbers and doi link
      publication <- x[["journal"]]
      if (!is.na(x[["volume"]])) publication <- paste0(publication, ", (", x[["volume"]], ")")
      if (!is.na(x[["number"]])) publication <- paste0(publication, ", ", x[["number"]])
      if (!is.na(x[["pages"]])) publication <- paste0(publication, ", _pp. ", x[["pages"]], "_")
      if (!is.na(x[["doi"]])) publication <- paste0(publication, ", ", paste0("https://doi.org/", x[["doi"]]))

      write(paste0("publication = \"", publication,"\""), fileConn, append = T)
      write(paste0("publication_short = \"", publication,"\""),fileConn, append = T)

      # Abstract and optional shortened version.
      if (abstract) {
        write(paste0("abstract = \"", x[["abstract"]],"\""), fileConn, append = T)
      } else {
        write("abstract = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      }
      write(paste0("abstract_short = \"","\""), fileConn, append = T)

      # Featured image thumbnail (optional) - keep empty can be customized later
      # in the md
      write("image_preview = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)

      # Is this a selected publication? (true/false) can be customized later
      write("selected = false", fileConn, append = T)

      # Projects (optional). can be customized later
      write("projects = []", fileConn, append = T)

      # Tags (optional). can be customized later
      write("tags = []", fileConn, append = T)

      # Links (optional). can be customized later
      write("url_pdf = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      write("url_preprint = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      write("url_code = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      write("url_dataset = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      write("url_project = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      write("url_slides = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      write("url_video = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      write("url_poster = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      write("url_source = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)

      # Custom links (optional).
      #   Uncomment line below to enable. For multiple links, use the form `[{...}, {...}, {...}]`.
      # url_custom = [{name = "Custom Link", url = "http://example.org"}]

      # Does this page contain LaTeX math? (true/false)
      write("math = false", fileConn, append = T)

      # Does this page require source code highlighting? (true/false)
      write("highlight = true", fileConn, append = T)

      # Featured image
      # Place your image in the `static/img/` folder and reference its filename
      #  below, e.g. `image = "example.jpg"`.
      write("[header]", fileConn, append = T)
      write("image = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)
      write("caption = \"\"", fileConn, append = T)

      write("+++", fileConn, append = T)

      # close(fileConn)
    }
  }
  # apply the "create_md" function over the publications list to generate
  # the different "md" files.
  apply(mypubs, FUN = function(x) create_md(x), MARGIN = 1)
}
```

Nothing fancy, here: I just use the [`RefManageR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RefManageR/index.html) 
package to read the bibtex file, and then cycles over publications to create 
files properly formatted for `hugo-academic` use. 

###Running the script

All is left is to run the script:

```{r eval=FALSE}

my_bibfile <- "/path/to/mybibtex.bib"
out_fold   <- "/path/to/myoutfolder"

bibtex_2academic(bibffile  = my_bibfile, 
                 outfold   = out_fold, 
                 abstract  = TRUE, 
                 overwrite = TRUE)

```

* The `outfold` argument allows specifying where the generated `md`s will be saved. 
Though in the end they will have to be moved to folder `content/publication` you 
may want to save them in a different folder to be able to check them before trying
to deploy them.

* The `abstract` argument specifies wheter to include the abstract in the `md` or 
not. 

Running the script will give you files like this one: 

```yml
+++
title = "Estimating canopy water content of poplar plantation from MIVIS data"
date = "2006-01-01"
authors = ["R. Colombo", "L. Busetto", "A. Marchesi", "M. Meroni", "C. Giardino"]
publication_types = ["1"]
publication = "AIP Conference Proceedings, (852), _pp. 242-249_, https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2349350"
publication_short = ""
abstract_short = ""
image_preview = ""
selected = false
projects = []
tags = []
url_pdf = ""
url_preprint = ""
url_code = ""
url_dataset = ""
url_project = ""
url_slides = ""
url_video = ""
url_poster = ""
url_source = ""
math = false
highlight = true
[header]
image = ""
caption = ""
+++
```

, where I tweaked a bit the hugo-academic format to include bibliographic 
info such as volume, number, pages and doi link. The files can then be further customized
to include, for example, links to pdfs, images, etcetera. 

After moving all the `md` files to `content/publication`, the publications section 
of your `hugo-academic` site will be auto-populated, and should look more or less
like this: 

![](/img/publications/publications.png)

You can have a look at the final results on my (under construction) website [here](https://lbusett.netlify.com/publication/). I think it's quite nice!

##Final Notes

* My importing script is quite "quick and dirty". It does not attempt to deal 
with special characters, and even substitutes accented letters with "bare"
letters to avoid rendering problems. If someone more knowledgeable about encoding
issues want to try and improve it, I put it in this gist
