We are happy to report that our [MODIStsp](https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp) package for 
automatic preprocessing of **MODIS time series** has been recently approved for being included in the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/packages/) ecosystem of `R` packages for reproducible science!

We wish to thank reviewers [**Leah Wasser**](https://github.com/lwasser) and [**Jeffrey Hanson**](https://github.com/jeffreyhanson) for providing really valuable insights during
the [onboarding review process](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/184). We think their 
contribution really helped in improving the package!

Please also note that **MODIStsp website was also migrated**, and is now available 
at http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/
