We are happy to report that a new version of [MODIStsp](http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/) (1.3.4) is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MODIStsp/index.html) as of today ! 

The new version introduces a **strongly improved GUI** (thanks mainly to @lwasser
comments in her [review for MODIStsp onboarding on ropensci](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/184)). The new GUI facilitates 
the selection of layers to be processed, and allows interactive selection of 
the processing spatial extent over a map (thanks to @timsalabim and @timelyportfolio 
for implementing some changes on mapview to allow this!). The main changes introduced in the GUI are
__highlighted in the image and animation below__:

Besides this, the **main changes with respect to version 1.3.3** are related to:

1. Inclusion of some __new MODIS products__;
2. __Removal of almost all v005 products__, which were recently deprecated by NASA;
3. __Removal of FTP download__ functionality again due to deprecation from NASA; 
4. __Improvement in functionality for dealing with NoData__ for products with multiple
fill-values. If "Change NoData" is set to "Yes", then in case a layer
has multiple Nodata values all those values are set to NA in the output;
5. __Miscellaneous bug fixing__ and code refactoring.

The full changelog for v1.3.4 can be found [HERE](https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp/releases/tag/v1.3.4)

We hope you will find the new version useful and that we didn't introduce too
many bugs ! **Please report any problems in our 
[issues](https://github.com/ropensci/MODIStsp/issues) GitHub page.**
