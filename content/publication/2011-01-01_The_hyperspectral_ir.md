abstract = "Reliable time series of vegetation optical properties are needed to improve the modeling of the terrestrial carbon budget with remote sensing data. This paper describes the development of an automatic spectral system able to collect continuous long-term in-field spectral measurements of spectral down-welling and surface reflected irradiance. The paper addresses the development of the system, named hyperspectral irradiometer (HSI), describes its optical design, the acquisition, and processing operations. Measurements gathered on a vegetated surface by the HSI are shown, discussed and compared with experimental outcomes with independent instruments. Â© 2011 American Institute of Physics."
