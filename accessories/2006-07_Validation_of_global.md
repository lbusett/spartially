abstract = "Initiated in 1984, the Committee Earth Observing Satellites' Working Group on Calibration and Validation (CEOS WGCV) pursues activities to coordinate, standardize and advance calibration and validation of civilian satellites and then- data. One subgroup of CEOS WGCV, Land Product Validation (LPV), was established in 2000 to define standard validation guidelines and protocols and to foster data and information exchange relevant to the validation of land products. Since then, a number of leaf area index (LAI) products have become available to the science com munity at both global and regional extents. Having multiple global LAI products and multiple, disparate validation activities related to these products presents the opportunity to realize efficiency through international collaboration. So the LPV subgroup established an international LAI Intel-comparison validation activity. This paper describes the main components of this international validation effort. The paper documents the current participants, then- ground LAI measurements and scaling techniques, and the metadata and infrastructure established to share data. The paper concludes by describing plans for sharing both field data and high-resolution LAI products from each site. Many considerations of this global LAI intercomparison can apply to other products, and this paper presents a framework for such collaboration. Â© 2006 IEEE."
