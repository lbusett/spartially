abstract = {The intensive rice cultivation area in northwestern Italy hosts the largest surface of rice paddies in Europe, and it is valued as a substantial habitat for aquatic biodiversity, with the paddies acting as a surrogate for the lost natural wetlands. The extent of submerged paddies strictly depends on crop management practices: in this framework, the recent diffusion of rice seeding in dry conditions has led to a reduction of flooded surfaces during spring and could have contributed to the observed decline of the populations of some waterbird species that exploit rice fields as foraging habitat. In order to test the existence and magnitude of a decreasing trend in the extent of submerged rice paddies during the rice-sowing period, MODIS remotely-sensed data were used to estimate the extent of the average flooded surface and the proportion of flooded rice fields in the years 2000–2016 during the nesting period of waterbirds. A general reduction of flooded rice fields during the rice-sowing season was observed, averaging     − 0.86 ± 0.20    % per year (p-value &lt; 0.01). Overall, the loss in submerged surface area during the sowing season reached     44 %     of the original extent in 2016, with a peak of     78 %     in the sub-districts to the east of the Ticino River. Results highlight the usefulness of remote sensing data and techniques to map and monitor water dynamics within rice cropping systems. These techniques could be of key importance to analyze the effects at the regional scale of the recent increase of dry-seeded rice cultivations on watershed recharge and water runoff and to interpret the decline of breeding waterbirds via a loss of foraging habitat.},

abstract={In this article, we propose an automatic procedure for classification of UAV imagery to map weed presence in rice paddies at early stages of the growing cycle. The objective was to produce a weed map (common weeds and cover crop remnants) to support variable rate technologies for site-specific weed management. A multi-spectral ortho-mosaic, derived from images acquired by a Parrot Sequoia sensor mounted on a quadcopter, was classified through an unsupervised clustering algorithm; cluster labelling into ‘weed’/‘no weed’ classes was achieved using geo-referenced observations. We tested the best set of input features among spectral bands, spectral indices and textural metrics. Weed mapping performance was assessed by calculating overall accuracy (OA) and, for the weed class, omission (OE) and commission errors (CE). Classification results were assessed under an ‘alarmist’ approach in order to minimise the chance of overestimating weed coverage. Under this condition, we found that best results are provided by a set of spectral indices (OA = 96.5%, weed CE = 2.0%). The output weed map was aggregated to a grid layer of 5 × 5 m to simulate variable rate management units; a weed threshold was applied to identify the portion of the field to be subject to treatment with herbicides. Ancillary information on weed and crop conditions were derived over the grid cells to support precision agronomic management of rice crops at the early stage of growth. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={Crop insurance is a viable solution to reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to risks from pest and disease outbreaks, extreme weather events, and market shocks that threaten their household food and income security. In developing and emerging countries, the implementation of area yield-based insurance, the form of crop insurance preferred by clients and industry, is constrained by the limited availability of detailed historical yield records. Remote-sensing technology can help to fill this gap by providing an unbiased and replicable source of the needed data. This study is dedicated to demonstrating and validating the methodology of remote sensing and crop growth model-based rice yield estimation with the intention of historical yield data generation for application in crop insurance. The developed system combines MODIS and SAR-based remote-sensing data to generate spatially explicit inputs for rice using a crop growth model. MODIS reflectance data were used to generate multitemporal LAI maps using the inverted Radiative Transfer Model (RTM). SAR data were used to generate rice area maps using MAPScape-RICE to mask LAI map products for further processing, including smoothing with logistic function and running yield simulation using the ORYZA crop growth model facilitated by the Rice Yield Estimation System (Rice-YES). Results from this study indicate that the approach of assimilating MODIS and SAR data into a crop growth model can generate well-adjusted yield estimates that adequately describe spatial yield distribution in the study area while reliably replicating official yield data with root mean square error, RMSE, of 0.30 and 0.46 t ha-1 (normalized root mean square error, NRMSE of 5% and 8%) for the 2016 spring and summer seasons, respectively, in the Red River Delta of Vietnam, as evaluated at district level aggregation. The information from remote-sensing technology was also useful for identifying geographic locations with peculiarity in the timing of rice establishment, leaf growth, and yield level, and thus contributing to the spatial targeting of further investigation and interventions needed to reduce yield gaps. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The ERMES agromonitoring system for rice cultivations integrates EO data at different resolutions, crop models, and user-provided in situ data in a unified system, which drives two operational downstream services for rice monitoring. The first is aimed at providing information concerning the behavior of the current season at regional/rice district scale, while the second is dedicated to provide farmers with field-scale data useful to support more efficient and environmentally friendly crop practices. In this contribution, we describe the main characteristics of the system, in terms of overall architecture, technological solutions adopted, characteristics of the developed products, and functionalities provided to end users. Peculiarities of the system reside in its ability to cope with the needs of different stakeholders within a common platform, and in a tight integration between EO data processing and information retrieval, crop modeling, in situ data collection, and information dissemination. The ERMES system has been operationally tested in three European rice-producing countries (Italy, Spain, and Greece) during growing seasons 2015 and 2016, providing a great amount of near-real-time information concerning rice crops. Highlights of significant results are provided, with particular focus on real-world applications of ERMES products and services. Although developed with focus on European rice cultivations, solutions implemented in the ERMES system can be, and are already being, adapted to other crops and/or areas of the world, thus making it a valuable testing bed for the development of advanced, integrated agricultural monitoring systems. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Agricultural monitoring has greatly benefited from the increased availability of a wide variety of remote-sensed satellite imagery, ground-sensed data (e.g., weather station networks) and crop models, delivering a wealth of actionable information to stakeholders to better streamline and improve agricultural practices. Nevertheless, as the degree of sophistication of agriculture monitoring systems increases, significant challenges arise due to the handling and integration of multi-scale data sources to present information to decision-makers in a way which is useful, understandable and user friendly. To address these issues, in this article we present the conceptual architecture and service-oriented implementation of a regional geoportal, specifically focused on rice crop monitoring in order to perform unified monitoring with a supporting system at regional scale. It is capable of storing, processing, managing, serving and visualizing monitoring and generated data products with different granularity and originating from different data sources. Specifically, we focus on data sources and data flow, and their importance for and in relation to different stakeholders. In the context of an EU-funded research project, we present an implementation of the regional geoportal for rice monitoring, which is currently in use in Europe’s three largest rice-producing countries, Italy, Greece and Spain. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={The triangle method has been applied to derive a weekly indicator of evaporative fraction on vegetated areas in a temperate region in Northern Italy. Daily MODIS Aqua Land Surface Temperature (MYD11A1) data has been combined with air temperature maps and 8-day composite MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1/MYD13Q1) data to estimate the Evaporative Fraction (EF) at 1 km resolution, on a daily basis. Measurements at two eddy covariance towers located within the study area have been exploited to assess the reliability of satellite based EF estimations as well as the robustness of input data. Weekly syntheses of the daily EF indicator (EFw) were then derived at regional scale for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 as a proxy of overall surface moisture condition. EFw showed a temporal behavior consistent with growing cycles and agro-practices of the main crops cultivated in the study area (rice, forages and corn). Comparison with official regional corn yield data showed that variations in EFw cumulated over summer are related with crop production shortages induced by water scarcity. These results suggest that weekly-averaged EF estimated from MODIS data is sensible to water stress conditions and can be used as an indicator of crops’ moisture conditions at agronomical district level. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach to provide information useful to issue operational near real time bulletins on crop conditions at regional scale are discussed. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Agricultural monitoring systems require spatio-temporal information on widely cultivated staple crops like rice. More emphasis has been made on area estimation and crop detection than on the temporal aspects of crop cultivation, but seasonal and temporal information such as i) crop duration, ii) date of crop establishment and iii) cropping intensity are as important as area for understanding crop production. Rice cropping systems are diverse because genetic, environmental and management factors (G  × E  × M combinations) influence the spatio-temporal patterns of cultivation. We present a rule based algorithm called PhenoRice for automatic extraction of temporal information on the rice crop using moderate resolution hypertemporal optical imagery from MODIS. Performance of PhenoRice against spatially and temporally explicit reference information was tested in three diverse sites: rice-fallow (Italy), rice-other crop (India) and rice-rice (Philippines) systems. Regional product accuracy assessments showed that PhenoRice made a conservative, spatially representative and robust detection of rice cultivation in all sites (r2 between 0.75 and 0.92) and crop establishment dates were in close agreement with the reference data (r2 = 0.98, Mean Error = 4.07 days, Mean Absolute Error = 9.95 days, p &lt; 0.01). Variability in algorithm performance in different conditions in each site (irrigated vs rainfed, direct seeding vs transplanting, fragmented vs clustered rice landscapes and the impact of cloud contamination) was analysed and discussed. Analysis of the maps revealed that cropping intensity and season length per site matched well with local information on agro-practices and cultivated varieties. The results show that PhenoRice is robust for deriving essential temporal descriptions of rice systems in both temperate and tropical regions at a level of spatial and temporal detail that is suitable for regional crop monitoring on a seasonal basis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Crop simulation models are commonly used to forecast the performance of cropping systems under different hypotheses of change. Their use on a regional scale is generally constrained, however, by a lack of information on the spatial and temporal variability of environment-related input variables (e.g., soil) and agricultural practices (e.g., sowing dates) that influence crop yields. Satellite remote sensing data can shed light on such variability by providing timely information on crop dynamics and conditions over large areas. This paper proposes a method for analyzing time series of MODIS satellite data in order to estimate the inter-annual variability of winter wheat sowing dates. A rule-based method was developed to automatically identify a reliable sample of winter wheat field time series, and to infer the corresponding sowing dates. The method was designed for a case study in the Camargue region (France), where winter wheat is characterized by vernalization, as in other temperate regions. The detection criteria were chosen on the grounds of agronomic expertise and by analyzing high-confidence time-series vegetation index profiles for winter wheat. This automatic method identified the target crop on more than 56% (four-year average) of the cultivated areas, with low commission errors (11%). It also captured the seasonal variability in sowing dates with errors of ±8 and ±16 days in 46% and 66% of cases, respectively. Extending the analysis to the years 2002–2012 showed that sowing in the Camargue was usually done on or around November 1st (±4 days). Comparing inter-annual sowing date variability with the main local agro-climatic drivers showed that the type of preceding crop and the weather conditions during the summer season before the wheat sowing had a prominent role in influencing winter wheat sowing dates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

This study combines the information conveyed by Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A into a high-resolution LAI retrieval chain. Rice crop was detected using an operational multi-temporal rule-based algorithm, and LAI estimates were obtained by inverting the PROSAIL radiative transfer model with Gaussian process regression. Direct validation was performed with in situ LAI measurements acquired in coordinated field campaigns in three countries (Italy, Spain and Greece). Results showed high consistency between estimates and ground measurements, revealing high correlations (R2 &gt; 0.93) and good accuracies (RMSE &lt; 0.83, rRMSEm &lt; 23.6% and rRMSEr &lt; 16.6%) in all cases. Sentinel-2A estimates were compared with Landsat-8 showing high spatial consistency between estimates over the three areas. The possibility to exploit seasonally-updated crop mask exploiting Sentinel-1A data and the temporal consistency between Sentinel-2A and Landsat-7/8 LAI time series demonstrates the feasibility of deriving operationally high spatial-temporal decametric multi-sensor LAI time series useful for crop monitoring.},

abstract={MODIStsp is a new R package allowing automating the creation of raster time series derived from MODIS Land Products. It allows performing several preprocessing steps (e.g. download, mosaicing, reprojection and resize) on MODIS products on a selected time period and area. All processing parameters can be set with a user-friendly GUI, allowing users to select which specific layers of the original MODIS HDF files have to be processed and which Quality Indicators have to be extracted from the aggregated MODIS Quality Assurance layers. Moreover, the tool allows on-the-fly computation of time series of Spectral Indexes (either standard or custom-specified by the user through the GUI) from surface reflectance bands. Outputs are saved as single-band rasters corresponding to each available acquisition date and output layer. Virtual files allowing easy access to the entire time series as a single file using common image processing/GIS software or R scripts can be also created. Non-interactive execution within an R script and stand-alone execution outside an R environment exploiting a previously created Options File are also possible, the latter allowing scheduling execution of MODIStsp to automatically update a time series when a new image is available. The proposed software constitutes a very useful tool for the Remote Sensing community, since it allows performing all the main preprocessing steps required for the creation of time series of MODIS data within a common framework, and without requiring any particular programming skills by its users. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study we present a method to estimate dynamics of presence of standing water (i.e. fraction of flooded area) in rice fields using MODIS data. First, we produced high resolution water presence maps from Landsat by thresholding the Normalised Difference Flood Index (NDFI) made: we made it by comparing five Landsat 8 images with field-obtained information about rice field status and water presence. Using these data we developed an empirical model to estimate the flooding fraction of each MODIS cell. Finally we validated the MODIS-based flooding maps with both Landsat and ground information. Results showed a good predictability of water surface from Landsat (OA = 92%) and a robust usability of MODIS data to predict water fraction (R2 = 0.73, EF = 0.57, RMSE = 0.13 at 1 × 1 km resolution). Analysis showed that the predictive ability of the model decreases with the greening up of rice, so we used NDVI to automatically discriminate estimations for inaccurate cells in order to provide the water maps with a reliability flag. Results demonstrate that it is possible to monitor water dynamics in rice paddies using moderate resolution multispectral satellite data. The achievement is a proof of concept for the analysis of MODIS archives to investigate irrigation dynamics in the last 15 years to retrieve information for ecological and hydrological studies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Leaf area index (LAI) is a key biophysical parameter used to determine foliage cover and crop growth in environmental studies in order to assess crop yield. Frequently, plant canopy analyzers (LAI-2000) and digital cameras for hemispherical photography (DHP) are used for indirect effective plant area index (PAIeff) estimates. Nevertheless, these instruments are expensive and have the disadvantages of low portability and maintenance. Recently, a smartphone app called PocketLAI was presented and tested for acquiring PAIeff measurements. It was used during an entire rice season for indirect PAIeff estimations and for deriving reference high-resolution PAIeff maps. Ground PAIeff values acquired with PocketLAI, LAI-2000, and DHP were well correlated (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.21 m2/m2 for Licor-2000, and R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.6 m2/m2 for DHP). Complementary data such as phenology and leaf chlorophyll content were acquired to complement seasonal rice plant information provided by PAIeff. High-resolution PAIeff maps, which can be used for the validation of remote sensing products, have been derived using a global transfer function (TF) made of several measuring dates and their associated satellite radiances. © 2016 by the authors.},

abstract={The agricultural sector is facing important global challenges due to the pressure of food demand, increased price-competition produced by market globalization and food price volatility (G20 Agriculture Action Plan), and the necessity of more environmentally and economically sustainable farming. Earth Observation (EO) systems can significantly contribute to these topics by providing reliable real time information on crop distribution, status and seasonal dynamics. ERMES FP7 project aims to create added-value information for the rice agro-sector by integrating EO-products in crop models. Time series of moderate resolution satellite data are analyzed exploiting the PhenoRice algorithm to retrieve seasonal occurrence of agro-practices and phenological stages. Eleven years (2003-2013) of rice seasonal metrics were derived and used in WARM crop model to set up a crop forecasting systems, with the aim to provide crop yield estimates for regional authorities. Preliminary test conducted in Italy on indica rice ecotype demonstrated that the system can provide rice yield estimates explaining up to 90% of interannual variability. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The RAdiative transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) activity focuses on the benchmarking of canopy radiative transfer (RT) models. For the current fourth phase of RAMI, six highly realistic virtual plant environments were constructed on the basis of intensive field data collected from (both deciduous and coniferous) forest stands as well as test sites in Europe and South Africa. Twelve RT modelling groups provided simulations of canopy scale (directional and hemispherically integrated) radiative quantities, as well as a series of binary hemispherical photographs acquired from different locations within the virtual canopies. The simulation results showed much greater variance than those recently analysed for the abstract canopy scenarios of RAMI-IV. Canopy complexity is among the most likely drivers behind operator induced errors that gave rise to the discrepancies. Conformity testing was introduced to separate the simulation results into acceptable and non-acceptable contributions. More specifically, a shared risk approach is used to evaluate the compliance of RT model simulations on the basis of reference data generated with the weighted ensemble averaging technique from ISO-13528. However, using concepts from legal metrology, the uncertainty of this reference solution will be shown to prevent a confident assessment of model performance with respect to the selected tolerance intervals. As an alternative, guarded risk decision rules will be presented to account explicitly for the uncertainty associated with the reference and candidate methods. Both guarded acceptance and guarded rejection approaches are used to make confident statements about the acceptance and/or rejection of RT model simulations with respect to the predefined tolerance intervals. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Aerobiological data can be used as indirect but reliable measures of flowering phenology to analyze the response of plant species to ongoing climate changes. The aims of this study are to evaluate the performance of several phenological models for predicting the pollen start of season (PSS) in seven spring-flowering trees (Alnus glutinosa, Acer negundo, Carpinus betulus, Platanus occidentalis, Juglans nigra, Alnus viridis, and Castanea sativa) and in two summer-flowering herbaceous species (Artemisia vulgaris and Ambrosia artemisiifolia) by using a 26-year aerobiological data set collected in Turin (Northern Italy). Data showed a reduced interannual variability of the PSS in the summer-flowering species compared to the spring-flowering ones. Spring warming models with photoperiod limitation performed best for the greater majority of the studied species, while chilling class models were selected only for the early spring flowering species. For Ambrosia and Artemisia, spring warming models were also selected as the best models, indicating that temperature sums are positively related to flowering. However, the poor variance explained by the models suggests that further analyses have to be carried out in order to develop better models for predicting the PSS in these two species. Modeling the pollen season start on a very wide data set provided a new opportunity to highlight the limits of models in elucidating the environmental factors driving the pollen season start when some factors are always fulfilled, as chilling or photoperiod or when the variance is very poor and is not explained by the models. © 2014, ISB.},

abstract={This study evaluates the potential of airborne remote sensing images to detect water stress in maize. Visible and near infrared CASI (Itres Research Ltd., Calgary, AL, Canada) and thermal AHS-160 (Sensytech Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) data were acquired at three different times during the day on a maize field (Zea mays L.) grown with three different irrigation treatments. An intensive field campaign was also conducted concurrently with image acquisition to measure leaf ecophysiological parameters and the leaf area index. The analysis of the field data showed that maize plants were experiencing moderate to severe water stress in rainfed plots and a weaker stress condition in the plots with a water deficit imposed between stem elongation and flowering. Vegetation indices including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) computed from the CASI images, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F760) and canopy temperature (Tc) showed different performances in describing the water stress during the day. During the morning overpass, NDVI was the index with the highest discriminant power due to the sensitivity of NDVI to maize canopy structure, affected by the water irrigation treatment. As the day progressed, processes related to heat dissipation through plant transpiration became more and more important and at midday Tc showed the best performances. Furthermore, Tc retrieved from the midday image was the only index able to distinguish all the three classes of water status. Finally, during the afternoon, PRI and F760 showed the best performances. These results demonstrate the feasibility to detect water stress using thermal and optical airborne data, pointing out the importance of careful planning of the airborne surveys as a function of the specific aims of the study. © 2015 by the authors.},

abstract={Asian countries strongly depend on rice production for food security. The major rice-growing season (June to October) is highly exposed to the risk of tropical storm related damage. Unbiased and transparent approaches to assess the risk of rice crop damage are essential to support mitigation and disaster response strategies in the region. This study describes and demonstrates a method for rapid, pre-event crop status assessment. The ex-post test case is Typhoon Haiyan and its impact on the rice crop in Leyte Province in the Philippines. A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) derived rice area map was used to delineate the area at risk while crop status at the moment of typhoon landfall was estimated from specific time series analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A spatially explicit indicator of risk of standing crop loss was calculated as the time between estimated heading date and typhoon occurrence. Results of the analysis of pre- and post-event SAR images showed that 6500 ha were flooded in northeastern Leyte. This area was also the region most at risk to storm related crop damage due to late establishment of rice. Estimates highlight that about 700 ha of rice (71% of which was in northeastern Leyte) had not reached maturity at the time of the typhoon event and a further 8400 ha (84% of which was in northeastern Leyte) were likely to be not yet harvested. We demonstrated that the proposed approach can provide pre-event, in-season information on the status of rice and other field crops and the risk of damage posed by tropical storms. © 2015 by the authors.},

abstract={In this study, a methodology based on the analysis of MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrora-diometer) time series was developed to estimate post-fire resilience of Alpine vegetation. To this end,satellite images of two vegetation indices (VIs), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) andthe Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were used. The analysis was conducted on wildfire affected areasin the Lombardy region (Italy) between 2003 and 2007. Some land surface (LS) descriptors (i.e. meanand maximum VI, growing season start, end and length) were extracted to characterize the time evolu-tion of the vegetation. The descriptors from a burned area were compared to those from an undisturbedadjacent control site by means of analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). Post-fire resilience was esti-mated on the basis of the number of subsequent years exhibiting a statistical difference between burnedarea and control site. The same methodologies were also applied to events aggregated by main landcover (broadleaf forest, prairies and mixed forest). The averaged resilience of broadleaf forest was 5-6years, whereas prairie ecosystems exhibited a faster response of 0-2 years. Phenological analysis revealedthat fire induces a shift of the start and end of growing season in forest ecosystems but has no effect onprairies. The method provides a useful and quantitative insight into complex post-fire vegetation dynam-ics in the Alps from a remote sensing perspective; results can apply to post-fire forest management andto multi-risk analysis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a method for mapping the nitrogen (N) status in a maize field using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. An airborne survey was conducted with an AISA Eagle hyperspectral sensor over an experimental farm where maize (Zea mays L.) was grown with two N fertilization levels (0 and 100 kg N ha-1) in four replicates. Leaf and canopy field data were collected during the flight. The nitrogen (N) status has been estimated in this work based on the Nitrogen Nutrition Index (NNI), defined as the ratio between the leaf actual N concentration (%Na) of the crop and the minimum N content required for the maximum biomass production (critical N concentration (%Nc)) calculated through the dry mass at the time of the flight (Wflight). The inputs required to calculate the NNI (i.e., %Na and Wflight) have been estimated through regression analyses between field data and remotely sensed vegetation indices. MCARI/MTVI2 (Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index/Modified Triangular Vegetation Index 2) showed the best performances in estimating the %Na (R2 = 0.59) and MTVI2 in estimating the Wflight (R2 = 0.80). The %Na and the Wflight were then mapped and used to compute the NNI map over the entire field. The NNI map agreed with the NNI estimated using field data through traditional destructive measurements (R2 = 0.70) confirming the potential of using remotely sensed indices to assess the crop N condition. Finally, a method to derive a pixel based variable rate N fertilization map was proposed as the difference between the actual N content and the optimal N content.

abstract={Narrow-band multispectral remote sensing techniques and thermal imagery were investigated for water stress detection in cereal crops. Visible and near infrared AISA Eagle (Specim, Finland) and thermal AHS-160 (Sensytech Inc., USA) imageries were acquired with an airborne survey on a farm-level experimental site where maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) were grown with three different irrigation treatments. Vegetation biophysical and eco-physiological measurements were collected concurrently with the airborne campaign. Leaf fluorescence yield (ΔF/Fm') resulted to be a good indirect measure of water stress. Therefore, ΔF/Fm' measurements were compared against remotely sensed indicators: (i) the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), (ii) the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence at 760 nm (F760), retrieved by the Fraunhofer line depth method and (iii) the canopy temperature (TC) calculated decoupling soil and vegetation contributions. TC was related to ΔF/Fm' with the highest determination coefficient (R2 = 0.65), followed by PRI586 (reference band at 586 nm) (R2 = 0.51). The relationship with F760 was significant but weaker (R2 = 0.36). The coefficient of determination increased up to 0.54 when pigment concentration was considered by multiplying ΔF/Fm' and chlorophyll content, confirming the close relationship between passive fluorescence signal, pigment content and light photosystem efficiency. PRI586, F760 and TC maps were produced in maize and sorghum plots. The differences in the average values of PRI586, F760 and TC extracted from the plots with different water treatments showed that water treatments were well discriminated in maize plots by the three remotely sensed indicators. This was confirmed by the visual observation of the PRI586, F760 and TC maps, while in sorghum plots, F760 and TC appeared more sensitive to water stress compared to PRI586. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Forest ecosystems play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Spatially explicit data and assessments of forest biomass and carbon are therefore crucial for designing and implementing effective sustainable forest management options and forest related policies. In this contribution, we present European-wide maps of forest biomass and carbon stock spatially disaggregated at 1km x 1km. The maps originated from a spatialisation improvement of the IPCC methodology for estimating the forest biomass at IPCC Tier 1 level (IPCC-T1). Using a categorical map of ecological zones within the mapping technique may originate boundary effects between the ecological zones. This may induce undue artifacts in the outcomes, as evident in previously published maps generated with the IPCC-T1 methodology. Here we present a novel method for IPCC-T1 biomass mapping which mitigates these artifacts. We propose the use of a fuzzy similarity map of the FAO ecological zones computed by estimating the relative distance similarity (RDS) of each grid-cells climate and geography with respect to the FAO ecological zones. A robust ensemble approach was used to merge an array of simple models with spatially distributed fuzzy set-membership. This allowed the boundary artifacts to be reduced, while mitigating the impact of model semantic extrapolation. The chain of semantically enhanced data-transformations is described following the semantic array programming paradigm. Preliminary results obtained from the application of this novel approach are presented along with a discussion of its impact on the derived maps. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

abstract={This paper presents a method for mapping water stress in a maize field using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. An airborne survey using AISA (Specim, Finland) was performed in July 2008 over an experimental farm in Italy. Hyperspectral data were acquired over a maize field with three different irrigation regimes. An intensive field campaign was also conducted concurrently with imagery acquisition to measure relative leaf water content (RWC), active chlorophyll fluorescence (δF/Fm'), leaf temperature (Tl) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). The analysis of the field data showed that at the time of the airborne overpass the maize plots with irrigation deficits were experiencing a moderate water stress, affecting the plant physiological status (δF/Fm', difference between Tl and air temperature (Tair), and RWC) but not the canopy structure (LAI). Among the different Vegetation Indices (VIs) computed from the airborne imagery the Photochemical Reflectance Index computed using the reflectance at 570nm as the reference band (PRI570) showed the strongest relationships with δF/Fm' (r2=0.76), Tl-Tair (r2=0.82) and RWC (r2=0.64) and the red-edge Chlorophyll Index (CIred-edge) with LAI (r2=0.64). Thus PRI has been proven to be related to water stress at early stages, before structural changes occurred. A method based on an ordinal logit regression model was proposed to map water stress classes based on airborne hyperspectral imagery. PRI570 showed the highest performances when fitted against water stress classes, identified by the irrigation amounts applied in the field, and was therefore used to map water stress in the maize field. This study proves the feasibility of mapping stress classes using hyperspectral indices and demonstrates the potential applicability of remote sensing data in precision agriculture for optimizing irrigation management. © 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract={This study investigates the performances in a terrestrial ecosystem of gross primary production (GPP) estimation of a suite of spectral vegetation indexes (VIs) that can be computed from currently orbiting platforms. Vegetation indexes were computed from near-surface field spectroscopy measurements collected using an automatic system designed for high temporal frequency acquisition of spectral measurements in the visible near-infrared region. Spectral observations were collected for two consecutive years in Italy in a subalpine grassland equipped with an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower that provides continuous measurements of net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO 2) exchange (NEE) and the derived GPP. Different VIs were calculated based on ESA-MERIS and NASA-MODIS spectral bands and correlated with biophysical (Leaf area index, LAI; fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by green vegetation, f IPARg), biochemical (chlorophyll concentration) and ecophysiological (green light-use efficiency, LUE g) canopy variables. In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was the index best correlated with LAI and f IPAR g (r = 0.90 and 0.95, respectively), the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) with leaf chlorophyll content (r = 0.91) and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI551), computed as (R 531 ?R551)/(R531 +R551) with LUEg (r = 0.64). Subsequently, these VIs were used to estimate GPP using different modelling solutions based on Monteith's lightuse efficiency model describing the GPP as driven by the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation (APARg) and by the efficiency (ε) with which plants use the absorbed radiation to fix carbon via photosynthesis. Results show that GPP can be successfully modelled with a combination of VIs and meteorological data or VIs only. Vegetation indexes designed to be more sensitive to chlorophyll content explained most of the variability in GPP in the ecosystem investigated, characterised by a strong seasonal dynamic of GPP. Accuracy in GPP estimation slightly improves when taking into account high frequency modulations of GPP driven by incident PAR or modelling LUEg with the PRI in model formulation. Similar results were obtained for both measured daily VIs and VIs obtained as 16-day composite time series and then downscaled from the compositing period to daily scale (resampled data). However, the use of resampled data rather than measured daily input data decreases the accuracy of the total GPP estimation on an annual basis.© Author(s) 2012. CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

At regional level it was carried out a correlation analysis between the mean dates of start and end of season detected from MODIS Terra and Aqua in different years. Regional maps of start and end of season were derived from MODIS data and the interannual phenological variability of both ecosystems was evaluated. Annual anomalies of the beginning of the growing season, obtained from satellite data, were related with air temperature anomalies, computed from meteorological stations, to evaluate the effects of recent climate variability on the vegetation phenological cycle. Comparison with field phenological observations showed that the start and the end of phenological cycle can be accurately determined from MODIS Terra and Aqua data and that an increase/decrease of 1°C in spring temperature lead to about 10 days in advance/ delay of the start of the growing season.},

abstract={The continuous and automated monitoring of canopy phenology is of increasing scientific interest for the multiple implications of vegetation dynamics on ecosystem carbon and energy fluxes. For this purpose we evaluated the applicability of digital camera imagery for monitoring and modeling phenology and physiology of a subalpine grassland over the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons.We tested the relationships between color indices (i.e. the algebraic combinations of RGB brightness levels) tracking canopy greenness extracted from repeated digital images against field measurements of green and total biomass, leaf area index (LAI), greenness visual estimation, vegetation indices computed from continuous spectroradiometric measurements and CO2 fluxes observed with the eddy covariance technique. A strong relationship was found between canopy greenness and (i) structural parameters (i.e., LAI) and (ii) canopy photosynthesis (i.e. Gross Primary Production; GPP). Color indices were also well correlated with vegetation indices typically used for monitoring landscape phenology from satellite, suggesting that digital repeat photography provides high-quality ground data for evaluation of satellite phenology products.We demonstrate that by using canopy greenness we can refine phenological models (Growing Season Index, GSI) by describing canopy development and considering the role of ecological factors (e.g., snow, temperature and photoperiod) controlling grassland phenology. Moreover, we show that canopy greenness combined with radiation use efficiency (RUE) obtained from spectral indices related to photochemistry (i.e., scaled Photochemical Reflectance Index) or meteorology (i.e., MOD17 RUE) can be used to predict daily GPP.Building on previous work that has demonstrated that seasonal variation in the structure and function of plant canopies can be quantified using digital camera imagery, we have highlighted the potential use of these data for the development and parameterization of phenological and RUE models, and thus point toward an extension of the proposed methodologies to the dataset collected within PhenoCam Network. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This research aims at developing a remote sensing technique for monitoring the interannual variability of the European larch phenological cycle in the Alpine region of Aosta Valley (Northern Italy) and to evaluate its relationships with climatic factors. Phenological field observations were conducted in eight test sites from 2005 to 2007 to determine the dates of completion of different phenological phases. MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) 250 m 16-days normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series were fitted with double logistic curves and the dates corresponding to different features of the curves were determined. Comparison with field data showed that the features of the fitted NDVI curve that allowed the best estimate of the start and end of the growing season were the zeroes of its third derivative (MAE of 6 and 4 days, respectively). The start and end of season were also estimated with the spring warming (SW) and growing season index (GSI) phenological models. MODIS start and end of season dates generally agreed with those obtained by the SW and GSI climate-driven phenological models. However, phenological models provided erroneous results when applied in years with anomalous meteorological conditions. The relationships between interannual variability of the larch phenological cycle and climate were investigated by comparing the mean start and end of season yearly anomalies with air temperature anomalies. A strong linear relationship (R2=0.91) was found between mean spring temperatures and mean start of season dates, with an increase of 1 °C in mean spring temperature leading to a 7-day anticipation of mean larch bud-burst date. Leaf coloring dates were found to be best related with mean September temperature (R2=0.77), but with higher spring temperatures appearing to lead to earlier leaf coloring. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This study investigates the possibility of monitoring carbon fixation of a terrestrial ecosystem from high spectral resolution field spectroscopy measurements. Canopy radiance spectra were collected under clear sky conditions using high resolution spectrometers which made it possible to estimate sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence at the oxygen absorption band O2-A located at 760nm (F760) as well as spectral vegetation indices. Spectral observations were collected in a rice field monitored with an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower measuring the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the crop.Estimation of gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) from remotely sensed data was based on the widely used light-use efficiency model (LUE), which states that carbon uptake is a function of the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (APAR) and light-use efficiency (e{open}) which represents the conversion efficiency of energy to fixed carbon.Hyperspectral data were used to derive both the APAR and the e{open} term. Different versions of the LUE model were formalized and tested with EC fluxes during two growing seasons. We started using a LUE model in which e{open} is held constant and remote sensing data are used to estimate APAR. We then investigated the improvements in GEP modelling provided by the partitioning between photosynthetic (PV) and non-photosynthetic (NPV) components of vegetation in APAR estimation, holding e{open} constant. The use of spectral indices related to APARPV instead of APAR resulted in an improvement in midday GEP estimation of about 50% with respect to the basic LUE model, average root mean square error in cross-validation (RMSEcv) of the model class from 9.69 to 4.49μmol CO2m-2s-1. Afterwards, we tested the use of the apparent fluorescence yield (Fy*760) and the scaled Photochemical Reflectance Index (sPRI) to derive e{open}. Modelling e{open} further improved the estimation of GEP up to an RMSEcv of 3.81μmol CO2m-2s-1 using Fy*760 and the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) and 3.67μmol CO2m-2s-1 using sPRI and F760 to estimate e{open} and APARPV, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The accurate spectral characterization of high-resolution spectrometers is required for correctly computing, interpreting, and comparing radiance and reflectance spectra acquired at different times or by different instruments. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for the spectral characterization of field spectrometer data using sharp atmospheric or solar absorption features present in the measured data. The algorithm retrieves systematic shifts in channel position and actual full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the instrument by comparing data acquired during standard field spectroscopy measurement operations with a reference irradiance spectrum modeled with the MODTRAN4 radiative transfer code. Measurements from four different field spectrometers with spectral resolutions ranging from 0.05 to 3:5nm are processed and the results validated against laboratory calibration. An accurate retrieval of channel position and FWHM has been achieved, with an average error smaller than the instrument spectral sampling interval. © 2010 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={Airborne hyperspectral remote observations, characterized by high spatial and spectral resolution, allow the estimation of quantitative vegetation variables useful in forest condition assessment. In this research, total chlorophyll (a + b) concentration (Cab), a biochemical variable describing crown discoloration rate, was mapped to assess oak (Quercus robur L.) condition in the Ticino Regional Park. A simulation experiment was conducted to evaluate the error in Cab estimation due to ecological variables (i.e. canopy leaf area index and understorey characteristics) and to sun-sensor configurations when optical indices are used. Canopy reflectance was simulated by means of the PROSPECT leaf radiative transfer model (Jacquemoud and Baret 1990) coupled with the SAILH canopy radiative transfer model, a variation of the SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) model modified to include the hot spot effect (Verhoef 1984, Kuusk 1991). The vegetation was modelled as a two layer medium with oak canopy as the top layer and the understorey as the bottom layer. Simulations were performed for varying leaf Cab and canopy Leaf Area Index (LAI) of the top layer, yl (mean leaf inclination angle) and LAI of the bottom layer (LAIu) and sun-sensor geometry. Optical indices were calculated and used in Cab retrieval. Simulations demonstrated that errors in Cab estimation were negligible when MTCI (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index) was used, thus indicating that MTCI was the most reliable index in mapping Cab in this forest environment. Empirical models based on optical indices were developed to map Cab from Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) images acquired by an airborne survey on the ark forested area. A regression analysis between Cab concentration measured in leaves sampled in field and optical indices computed from hyperspectral MIVIS data was conducted. The MTCI index showed the highest performances and was therefore used to map Cab concentration of the Ticino Park oak forest. The Cab map was then used to assess crown discoloration level. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={The Fraunhofer Line Discriminator (FLD) principle has long been considered as the reference method to quantify solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) from passive remote sensing measurements. Recently, alternative retrieval algorithms based on the spectral fitting of hyperspectral radiance observations, Spectral Fitting Methods (SFMs), have been proposed. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate the performance of such algorithms and to provide relevant information regarding their use. FLD and SFMs were used to estimate F starting from Top Of Canopy (TOC) fluxes at very high spectral resolution (0.12 nm) and sampling interval (0.1 nm), exploiting the O2-B (687.0 nm) and O2-A (760.6 nm) atmospheric oxygen absorption bands overlapping the fluorescence emissions at the red and far-red spectral window. Specific parameters affecting FLD and SFM performances are investigated and the accuracy of F estimation of the two methods is compared. The problem related to the lack of independent measurements of F at canopy level, which prevents the direct assessment of F estimation accuracy with actual measurements, is overcome in this study by using a modeled database of TOC reflectance spectra. In order to compute accuracy figures valid for operative applications the simulated spectra were perturbed by the addition of radiometric noise. An investigation was conducted to determine the best FLD channel configuration; it showed that violation of FLD assumptions results in a positive bias in F estimation at both oxygen absorption bands that cannot be avoided even at the high spectral resolution considered. SFMs were shown to be more accurate than FLD under any noise configuration considered. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Field data were collected in the season 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 in 25 and 42 sites respectively. The analyzed sites were classified in three rangeland degradation classes, on the basis of expert knowledge. Quantitative indicators of rangeland condition were also measured in a subset of sites. We analyzed the relationship between MODIS NDVI time series and measured properties of rangeland vegetation, in order to assess which factor related to vegetation condition may have a major influence on the NDVI seasonal profile. The Local NPP Scaling (LNS) method was then applied and its potential for discriminating the degradation classes was evaluated. Finally, LNS maps were generated for the period 2000-2008 and analyzed to identify areas which exhibited persistently low LNS values. Results indicate that the LNS method applied on MODIS NDVI time series allows mapping Mediterranean rangeland conditions in central Sardinia and could represent an important tool for preventing land degradation phenomena.},

abstract={In this paper we present results obtained in the framework of a regional-scale analysis of the carbon budget of poplar plantations in Northern Italy. We explored the ability of the process-based model BIOME-BGC to estimate the gross primary production (GPP) using an inverse modeling approach exploiting eddy covariance and satellite data. We firstly present a version of BIOME-BGC coupled with the radiative transfer models PROSPECT and SAILH (named PROSAILH-BGC) with the aims of i) improving the BIOME-BGC description of the radiative transfer regime within the canopy and ii) allowing the assimilation of remotely-sensed vegetation index time series, such as MODIS NDVI, into the model. Secondly, we present a two-step model inversion for optimization of model parameters. In the first step, some key ecophysiological parameters were optimized against data collected by an eddy covariance flux tower. In the second step, important information about phenological dates and about standing biomass were optimized against MODIS NDVI. Results obtained showed that the PROSAILH-BGC allowed simulation of MODIS NDVI with good accuracy and that we described better the canopy radiation regime. The inverse modeling approach was demonstrated to be useful for the optimization of ecophysiological model parameters, phenological dates and parameters related to the standing biomass, allowing good accuracy of daily and annual GPP predictions. In summary, this study showed that assimilation of eddy covariance and remote sensing data in a process model may provide important information for modeling gross primary production at regional scale. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Vegetation phenology is strongly influenced by climatic factors. Climate changes may cause phenological variations, especially in the Alps which are considered to be extremely vulnerable to global warming. The main goal of our study is to analyze European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) phenology in alpine environments and the role of the ecological factors involved, using an integrated approach based on accurate field observations and modelling techniques. We present 2 years of field-collected larch phenological data, obtained following a specifically designed observation protocol. We observed that both spring and autumn larch phenology is strongly influenced by altitude. We propose an approach for the optimization of a spring warming model (SW) and the growing season index model (GSI) consisting of a model inversion technique, based on simulated look-up tables (LUTs), that provides robust parameter estimates. The optimized models showed excellent agreement between modelled and observed data: the SW model predicts the beginning of the growing season (B GS) with a mean RMSE of 4 days, while GSI gives a prediction of the growing season length (LGS) with a RMSE of 5 days. Moreover, we showed that the original GSI parameters led to consistent errors, while the optimized ones significantly increased model accuracy. Finally, we used GSI to investigate interactions of ecological factors during springtime development and autumn senescence. We found that temperature is the most effective factor during spring recovery while photoperiod plays an important role during autumn senescence: photoperiod shows a contrasting effect with altitude decreasing its influence with increasing altitude. © 2008 ISB.},

abstract={This study investigates the applicability of empirical and radiative transfer models to estimate water content at leaf and landscape level. The main goal is to evaluate and compare the accuracy of these two approaches for estimating leaf water content by means of laboratory reflectance/transmittance measurements and for mapping leaf and canopy water content by using airborne Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) data acquired over intensive poplar plantations (Ticino, Italy). At leaf level, we tested the performance of different spectral indices to estimate leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) and leaf gravimetric water content (GWC) by using inverse ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and reduced major axis (RMA) regression. The analysis showed that leaf reflectance is related to changes in EWT rather than GWC, with best results obtained by using RMA regression by exploiting the spectral index related to the continuum removed area of the 1200 nm water absorption feature with an explained variance of 61% and prediction error of 6.6%. Moreover, we inverted the PROSPECT leaf radiative transfer model to estimate leaf EWT and GWC and compared the results with those obtained by means of empirical models. The inversion of this model showed that leaf EWT can be successfully estimated with no prior information with mean relative errors of 14% and determination coefficient of 0.65. Inversion of the PROSPECT model showed some difficulties in the simultaneous estimation of leaf EWT and dry matter content, which led to large errors in GWC estimation. At landscape level with MIVIS data, we tested the performance of different spectral indices to estimate canopy water per unit ground area (EWTcanopy). We found a relative error of 20% using a continuum removed spectral index around 1200 nm. Furthermore, we used a model simulation to evaluate the possibility of applying empirical models based on appositely developed MIVIS double ratios to estimate mean leaf EWT at landscape level (over(EWT, -)). It is shown that combined indices (double ratios) yielded significant results in estimating leaf EWT at landscape level by using MIVIS data (with errors around 2.6%), indicating their potential in reducing the effects of LAI on the recorded signal. The accuracy of the empirical estimation of EWTcanopy and over(EWT, -) was finally compared with that obtained from inversion of the PROSPECT + SAILH canopy reflectance model to evaluate the potential of both methods for practical applications. A relative error of 27% was found for EWTcanopy and an overestimation of leaf over(EWT, -) with relative errors around 19%. Results arising from this remote sensing application support the robustness of hyperspectral regression indices for estimating water content at both leaf and landscape level, with lower relative errors compared to those obtained from inversion of leaf and 1D canopy radiative transfer models. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The potential of multitemporal coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed images for vegetation monitoring is reduced in fragmented landscapes, where most of the pixels are composed of a mixture of different surfaces. Several approaches have been proposed for the estimation of reflectance or NDVI values of the different land-cover classes included in a low resolution mixed pixel. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the estimation of sub-pixel NDVI values from multitemporal coarse resolution satellite data. Sub-pixel NDVIs for the different land-cover classes are calculated by solving a weighted linear system of equations for each pixel of a coarse resolution image, exploiting information about within-pixel fractional cover derived from a high resolution land-use map. The weights assigned to the different pixels of the image for the estimation of sub-pixel NDVIs of a target pixel i are calculated taking into account both the spatial distance between each pixel and the target and their spectral dissimilarity estimated on medium-resolution remote-sensing images acquired in different periods of the year. The algorithm was applied to daily and 16-day composite MODIS NDVI images, using Landsat-5 TM images for calculation of weights and accuracy evaluation. Results showed that application of the algorithm provided good estimates of sub-pixel NDVIs even for poorly represented land-cover classes (i.e., with a low total cover in the test area). No significant accuracy differences were found between results obtained on daily and composite MODIS images. The main advantage of the proposed technique with respect to others is that the inclusion of the spectral term in weight calculation allows an accurate estimate of sub-pixel NDVI time series even for land-cover classes characterized by large and rapid spatial variations in their spectral properties. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={This study examines the use of reflectance measurements acquired with field spectroradiometers and with the airborne Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) for mapping canopy water content in a poplar plantation located in the Ticino Natural Park (Italy). Different water spectral indices were investigated by using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression techniques in order to determine the equivalent water thickness (EWT) and the gravimetric water content (GWC) at leaf and plantation level. Significant correlations were found between EWT and selected vegetation indices at leaf level. The results have shown that leaf reflectance is related to EWT but not to gravimetric water content. However, at canopy level, spectral indices sensing canopy water content appear to respond not only to the canopy water content but also to canopy structure, providing a useful method for mapping the vegetation leaf area index at the experimental site. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Initiated in 1984, the Committee Earth Observing Satellites' Working Group on Calibration and Validation (CEOS WGCV) pursues activities to coordinate, standardize and advance calibration and validation of civilian satellites and then- data. One subgroup of CEOS WGCV, Land Product Validation (LPV), was established in 2000 to define standard validation guidelines and protocols and to foster data and information exchange relevant to the validation of land products. Since then, a number of leaf area index (LAI) products have become available to the science com munity at both global and regional extents. Having multiple global LAI products and multiple, disparate validation activities related to these products presents the opportunity to realize efficiency through international collaboration. So the LPV subgroup established an international LAI Intel-comparison validation activity. This paper describes the main components of this international validation effort. The paper documents the current participants, then- ground LAI measurements and scaling techniques, and the metadata and infrastructure established to share data. The paper concludes by describing plans for sharing both field data and high-resolution LAI products from each site. Many considerations of this global LAI intercomparison can apply to other products, and this paper presents a framework for such collaboration. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Rice is one of the most important crops in the whole world, providing staple food for more than 3000 million people. For this reason FAO declared the year 2004 as The International Year of Rice promoting initiatives and researches on this valuable crop. Assessing the Net Primary Production (NPP) is fundamental to support a sustainable development and to give crop yield forecast essential to food security policy. Crop growth models can be useful tools for estimating growth, development and yield but require complex spatial distributed input parameters to produce valuable map. Light use efficiency (LUE) models, using satellite-borne data to achieve daily surface parameters, represent an alternative approach able to monitor differences in vegetation compound providing spatial distributed NPP maps. An experiment aimed at testing the capability of a LUE model using daily MODIS data to estimate rice crop production was conducted in a rice area of Northern Italy. Direct LAI measurements and indirect LAI2000 estimation were collected on different fields during the growing season to define a relationship with MODIS data. An hyperspectral MIVIS image was acquired in early July on the experimental site to provide high spatial resolution information on land cover distribution. LUE-NPP estimations on several fields were compared with CropSyst model outputs and field biomass measurements. A comparison of different methods performance is presented and relative advantages and drawbacks in spatialization are discussed.},

abstract={Knowledge of the characteristics of the vegetation cover is of great interest due to its role in the mass and energy exchanges at the surface/atmosphere interface (e.g. water and carbon cycles). This study is part of DARFEM experiments, EU-funded HySens project (DLR), designed to provide a better understanding of the capability of airborne hyperspectral and directional observations to retrieve biophysical vegetation parameters. Different airborne hyperspectral data were acquired in late June 2001 on the experimental site, a poplar plantation belonging to CARBOEUROFLUX network, located in Northern Italy. An intensive field campaign was accomplished during the aerial survey to collect vegetation parameters and radiometric measurements. Leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation fractional cover (Fc), were retrieved from remote sensing data by statistical relationships with ground measurements. A radiative transfer model was used in direct mode to simulate and analyse the canopy spectral signature changes for varying overstory LAI and different understory conditions. In order to minimize the influence of the extensive understory vegetation on the relationship between spectral Vegetation Index (VI) and LAI, an optical index exploiting short wave infrared (SWIR) was evaluated. A comparison of different Vis performance is presented and relative advantages and drawbacks of SWIR exploitation are discussed.},

abstract={Previous studies have already shown the hyperspectral remote sensing attitude in recognition and identification of asbestos-containing roofs. These surfaces, used in both agricultural and urban buildings, represent a strong environmental problem for their proved toxic influence on human health, causing potential pathogenic effects on the respiratory system. In Italy, the law N°257/1992 forbade any use of asbestos derived materials and, for what concerns asbestos concrete sheetings, it required the Public Administrations to take a census of buildings with asbestos-containing roofs. The aim or this research is to test the possibility to use the MIVIS (Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer) airborne hyperspectral scanner to map asbestos concrete sheeting inside a metropolitan area of north Italy. The paper reports the results obtained from the application of different methods of MIVIS data processing and classification, with reference to two specific cases of study. © 2001 IEEE.},
