      <description>MODIStsp v1.3.0 has been finally released !
It adds the much-needed functionality for downloading and preprocessing MODIS Collection 006 datasets. Off-line preprocessing of already downloaded hdf images was also improved, and the GUI was a bit revamped to improve user-friendliness (A detailed changelog can be found here).
More detailed usage instructions were also added to the main github page, and a FAQ section addressing common issues with the package (e.g., installation problems, etc) was added.</description>

      <description>In this post, we are introducing MODIStsp a new &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; package allowing to automatize the creation of time series of rasters derived from Land Products data derived from MODIS satellite data (; www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300416303107).
Development of MODIStsp started from modifications of the ModisDownload &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; script by Thomas Hengl (spatial-analyst.net/wiki/index.php?title=Download_and_resampling_of_MODIS_images), and successive adaptations by Babak Naimi (r-gis.net/?q=ModisDownload). Their functionalities were gradually incremented with the aim of:
 Developing a standalone application allowing to perform several preprocessing steps (e.</description>
